SIDO project aims in improving the performance of code regions by applying various code transformations or provide hints to the application developer on hand
optimizing the code for a given platform. We measure CPU architectural events and memory stalls
to identify performance bottlenecks and guide loop level transformation and other optimizations for
optimal code generation.
